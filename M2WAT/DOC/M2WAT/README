M2WAT - Convert mTCP configuration file to WATTCP file
Copyright 2011 by Cordata

M2WAT will edit the WATTCP configuration file and input the 
configuration parameters which are contained in the mTCP config file. 
This would normally be done when using the mTCP DHCP utility. 

The MTCP.CFG environment variable is used to find the MTCP config 
file. The WATTCP.CFG environment variable is optional, if not present 
the current working directory is used. 

Note that the MTCP.CFG variable must refer to a file while the 
WATTCP.CFG variable refers to a directory. The WATTCP.CFG file is 
always called WATTCP.CFG. If the WATTCP.CFG file does not exist the 
option is provided to create it. 

Currently M2WAT will add the IP address, Gateway, Netmask and 
nameserver to the WATTCP.CFG file from the mTCP config file. 

To use M2WAT there are no command line parameters or options. 
All information is taken from the environment variables.
